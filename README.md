# Flight Search React App

This project is a flight search application built using React. It allows users to search for flights, view available options, and explore flight details. The app is integrated with the Sky Scraper API via RapidAPI to fetch real-time flight information.

## Features

- **Flight Search**: Users can input their departure and destination cities, select travel dates, and search for available flights.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Flight Information**: After searching, users can view details for each flight, including airline, price, duration, and more.
- **Real-time Data**: The app fetches live flight data from the Sky Scraper API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will reload automatically when changes are made. You can also check for lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode. For more information, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes React in production mode for better performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

Once the build is complete, your app is ready to be deployed.
